## [1.0.0] â€“ 2024-05-29
  

### Added
- Initial support for running the GeForce NOW script on **non-SteamOS Linux distributions**.
- Detection of `com.google.Chrome` as Flatpak dependency.
- Automatic installation logic for `com.google.Chrome` from Flathub.
- Logging system to capture information, warnings and errors.

### Changed
- Replaced `steamos-add-to-steam` logic with a fallback that skips Steam integration when running outside of SteamOS.
- Adjusted controller config path handling to avoid relying on Steam Deck paths.
- Improved system checks to correctly identify generic Linux environments.
- Now the script prompts the user to choose between system/user Flatpak installations when necessary.

### Removed
- Dependencies exclusive to SteamOS or Steam Deck.
- Hardcoded reliance on Steam-specific paths or executables.

## Notes
- This is an **unofficial modification** of a script provided by NVIDIA.
- The original script was designed solely for SteamOS use and required adaptation to work under other environments.
